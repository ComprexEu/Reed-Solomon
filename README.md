# Reed-Solomon

The purpose of this project is to get a deeper understanding of a Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding system.
This program has more of an educational meaning in which maner we will conduct a series of experiments consisting of changes in decoder and encoder parameters.
Our language of choice is python.
We will use a object based programing paradigm.
